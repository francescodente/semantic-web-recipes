The system should also be able to recommend best-matched substitutions for ingredients where appropriate in order to meet the userâ€™s taste preferences or food allergy related needs. The users are allowed to specify the meal types (e.g. lunch) and course types (e.g. entree) in the request. If the users request not to have recipes that contain high Glycemic Index (GI) ingredients, the system will avoid offering these high glycemic recipes in the recommendations." ;

Crustaceans are prepared for wholesale or retail distribution at a \"raw\" stage, often still alive, \"raw\" and deep-frozen or cooked directly after catching and deep-frozen. Shrimps or prawns may also be parboiled and thereafter deep-frozen.
Although the cooked or parboiled crustaceans should be regarded as processed foods, the animals of this group are primarily classified in the Chapter on Primary food commodities, Type 8: Aquatic animal products, since several crustaceans are also-marketed in a \"raw\" form, i.e. not exposed to temperatures sufficiently high to coagulate the protein at the surface. A short reference to processed Crustaceans is given in Type 17: Derived edible products of animal origin, Group 084 Crustaceans, processed.
The entire commodity except the shell may be consumed: the \"raw\" commodities, in general, after cooking.

In some countries, species such as the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) are included in the commodity \"Prawns\" with some qualifying designation, such as Dublin Bay Prawn or Prawn of Bantry Bay (both Ireland).The Codex Stan. 92-1981 on Quick Frozen Shrimps and Prawns does not prevent this practice, provided that the designation on the label ensures that the consumer will not be misled.
There is no clear-cut distinction between Shrimps and Prawns. In several countries the commodity name-Shrimps is used for the small species whereas the slightly larger ones are called Prawns. However, a species marked in certain regions of the world as \"Prawn\" may be called in the local English language in other areas a shrimp and visa versa, e.g., Pandalus borcalis is called Northern prawn or Deepwater prawn in the United Kingdom and the same species is named Pink shrimp in Canada. In Australia only the name Prawn is used for animals included in this commodity.
